# Bike Accessibility and Transportation Equity in Montgomery County, MD

The above script is the analysis central to my 12-week capstone project for a Master's of Science in geospatial information science at the Univerity of Maryland in the fall of 2020. The script accepts origin points, destination points, and a property parcel layer, and loops through scenarios (comprising different network network datasets) where it conducts an OD-Cost Matrix network analysis, counts the number of destinations reachable from each origin on the network dataset, and adds this count as an attribute on the parcel layer.
